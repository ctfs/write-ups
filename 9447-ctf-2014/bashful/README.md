## Write-up

This is similar to tumorous. Going to bashful.9447.plumbing there is a mention about learning git and hiding token. Git repositories have a .git folder where information about the repository is stored.

So we browse to [bashful.9447.plumbing/.git/](http://bashful.9447.plumbing/.git/) and see the .git/logs/HEAD file. It says 

````

````

Someone did commit the flag but they've probably deleted it now. So we look at the .git/objects directory to see if any commit objects can be found. There seems to be none. 

They might have packed the commit objects. Let's look at .git/objects/info/packs . 
```
I banish thee, evil mind readers from planet Zblaargh. 
```

<hr>
In the initial version of the challenge we were supposed to find the pack name on our own by directly entering its url. Pack names are formed like pack-<SHA1>.<pack,idx> where <SHA1> is a hash of the sorted object names to make the resulting filename based on the pack content.

Unfortunately there was no (?) way to find out the object name of the token file without knowing the token itself? Anyhow, no team could solve this challenge at that difficulty level. And that's why the organizers reduced the complexity from 310 to 101 points and made the directories browseable.

<hr>

Okay, maybe we can just fetch the pack from the packs directory. .git/objects/pack
````
pack-deff83d57714493c6d317394f3542da8e396f887.idx
pack-deff83d57714493c6d317394f3542da8e396f887.pack
````

Fine, now we need to unpack the pack file. An easy way out was to refer to [this SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/3333428/589184) and create an alias git unpack-refs.

On unpacking, `git status` shows
````
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	deleted:    index.html
	deleted:    token
````

Easy now. Do 
````
$ git checkout token
$ cat token
9447{I_JUST_THINK_BITCOIN_WILL_DIE_OUT_SOON}
