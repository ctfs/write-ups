## Write-up


### Analyzing the provided file
Let’s see what [the provided file](impday_92fe19a8b4b2ad415e9d8e1e6aba67aa) could be:

```bash
$ file impday_92fe19a8b4b2ad415e9d8e1e6aba67aa
impday_92fe19a8b4b2ad415e9d8e1e6aba67aa: xz compressed data
```

So, we extract the file using the built-in `xz` or `unxz` commands:

* `xz -dc < impday_92fe19a8b4b2ad415e9d8e1e6aba67aa > impday`
* `unxz < impday_92fe19a8b4b2ad415e9d8e1e6aba67aa > impday`

Alternatively, extract the provided file using [p7zip](http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/):

```bash
7z x impday_92fe19a8b4b2ad415e9d8e1e6aba67aa
```

Let’s find out what the extracted file is:

```bash
$ file impday
impday: tcpdump capture file (little-endian) - version 2.4 (Ethernet, capture length 1514)
```

### Brute forcing the flag
From the ASIS quals 2014 we remembered that checking a flag was done client side.
The flag submission page contained a hidden field called `id_check` which was used to check the flag:
```
if (sha256(sha256(flag)) == id_check) {
	// flag is correct
}
```
A quick check in the flag submission code tells us the finals are no different.

This is interesting, because it gives us the power to brute force flags locally.

The challenge suggests we needed a date in the format `+%Y:%m:%d:%H:%M`. This means we only care about minutes, not seconds which makes the date rather easy to brute force.
Using wireshark we found that the first packet in the provided pcap file had with timestamp `1412157562`, so the system must've been started some time before that.

We brute forced the flag using the following script:
```python
import datetime
import hashlib

def check_flag(flag):
	hash1 = hashlib.sha256(flag)
	hex1 = hash1.hexdigest()
	hash2 = hashlib.sha256(hex1)
	hex2 = hash2.hexdigest()

	return hex2 == "5ed2645dfc6752f1b105c422d07dcd73807758d259c5783c10bea8b0426b77df"

time = 1412157562
flag_found = False

while not flag_found:
	time -= 60
	time_str = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(time).strftime('%Y:%m:%d:%H:%M')
	md5hash = hashlib.md5(time_str)
	md5hex = md5hash.hexdigest()
	flag = "ASIS_%s" % md5hex
	if check_flag(flag):
		print flag
		flag_found = True
```

After a couple of seconds this printed out the flag: `ASIS_d6f98bae92a83f10ca6c488c4612e8fc`
