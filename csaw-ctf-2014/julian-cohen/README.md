## Write-up

(TODO)

The challenge author [set up an OkCupid profile](http://www.okcupid.com/profile/hockeyinjune) whose ‘self-summary’ is as follows:

> `flag{flowers_and_wine_will_get_me}`

The flag is `flowers_and_wine_will_get_me`.

([This one](http://www.okcupid.com/profile/TheJulianCohen) also works too. The flag is `julian_will_not_date_you_sorry`.)
