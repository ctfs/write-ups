## Write-up

[The provided PDF file](pdf.pdf) contains some hidden text.

One way to get to it is by opening the PDF in your viewer of choice, selecting all of its contents (using `Ctrl` + `A` or `âŒ˜` + `A`), copying it, and then pasting it into your text editor of choice.

Another possible solution is to use the `pdftotext` command-line utility:

```bash
$ pdftotext pdf.pdf

$ strings pdf.txt
flag{security_through_obscurity}
```

The flag is `security_through_obscurity`.
