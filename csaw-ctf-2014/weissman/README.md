## Write-up

Here is a [Java-Based solution](CSAWlz.java) to this challenge.

During the CTF, it seems that most (probably all) of the people who solved it, didn't completely decompress the files contained within the archive, but were able to get the important file (key.jpg) readable enough simply by filling the space required with zeros, as described in the link below.

After the CTF was complete, I asked to author (RyanWithZombies) if he was going to do a write up, but he said he wasn't and linked me to the C++ source he used to compress the archive (https://gist.github.com/withzombies/909b403852ea1e31f553). I was able to port the decompressing and hashing code to Java and incorporate it into the code I wrote during the CTF. Our team didn't actually get the key in time (oh well) but i was interested enough to keep poking at this until I got it to work.

Roughly, the process of extracting a single file is this:
- first, create a _hashmap_ to store uncompressed data blocks
- read the first byte from the _input_, which is a _control byte_
 
Then in a loop, do this:
- _control byte_ >> 1;  to extract the _size_ of the current data block
- _control byte_ & 0b00000001) != 0b00000001; to determine if the block is _compressed_ or not (if the statement evaluates to true, the block is compressed)
 
If the block is not _compressed_:
- read _size_ number of bytes from the _input_ and store them in a _buffer_.
- create a _hash_ of the first 4 bytes in the buffer
- store the buffered bytes in the _hashmap_ using the _hash_ as the key
- write the _buffer_ to _output_
- read the next _control byte_ if it exists and restart the loop

if the block is _compressed_:
- read two bytes from the _input_, these bytes are the _hash_
- using the _hash_ as the key, get the bytes stored in the _hashmap_ 
- read _size_ number of bytes from the bytes you just retrieved from the hashmap into a _buffer_
- write the bytes in the _buffer_ to the _output_
- read the next _control byte_ if it exists and retsart the loop

when you find that the next _control byte_ doesn't exist, you are done and can write the _output_ to disk.

As stated, this is a very rough outline of what is actually going on, check out the [CSAWlz.java](CSAWlz.java) file for a better understanding of exactly what happens during decompressing.

Thanks to RyanWithZombies for an interesting challenge!
