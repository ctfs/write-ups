## Write-up

By seeing the question and question given above it was easy to say that the flag was in the of the githubs accounts of the admin's 

There is no other way of finding the flag except manually searching all the commits done by him as the flag was deleted :( So you won't find the flag even if you search the whole code. Also the commit was made a month ago at the time of competation so it becomes more difficult to find the flag.

And by manually searching all the commits you will reach this commit which contains the flag <https://github.com/karthiksenthil/Learn-Git/commit/9cd4ecad6f7c545ef5ac31622d503de811191d7b>


flag '0ctocat_c4n_play_h1de_and_s33k'
