## Write-up
By googling more about the ctf we get the name of the organizing team as NIA (No Internet Access), they have also given the same in the hint indirectly.

Once you find the team name, googling about the team should have given you this link of ctftime <https://ctftime.org/team/8096>


Bingo one you visit the above page you get the blog of the NIA team as <http://nia-ctf.github.io/>
