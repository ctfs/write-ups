# Hack.lu CTF 2014: Gunslinger Joeâ€™s private Terminal

**Category:** Misc

**Description:**

> Gunslinger Joe has a pretty bad memory and always forgets the password for his private terminals! That's why he always uses his username as password but also makes sure that absolutely no one else who knows his name can interact with his secure terminal. Wouldn't it be super embarrassing for him to prove him wrong?
