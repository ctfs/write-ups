**Description:**

> Our biggest competitor the mining corporation, The Union, has a new way of organizing its mining facilities. On the surface, it looks like a mining location archive. But our man inside told us, it has a secret trapdoor that we can use to infiltrate the corporation and steal their secret. We need their secret. They have one success after another and it will not be long until we are finished. Our informant also told us that not everything is what it seems to be. We do not know what this means. Luckily for us, he managed to get us the blueprints of the system. So we should be able to study them before we went for the heist. So, this is your job. Study the blueprints and then go for the valuable “secret.txt”. This is everything we need to overcome them.
