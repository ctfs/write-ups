**Description:**

> It's gold rush time! The New York Herald just reported about the Californian gold rush. We know a sheriff there is hiring guys to help him fill his own pockets. We know he already has a deadful amount of gold in his secret vault. However, it is protected by a secret only he knows. When new deputies apply for the job, they get their own secret, but that only provies entry to a vault of all deputy sheriffs. No idiot would store their stuff in this vault. But maybe we can find a way to gain access to the sheriff's vault? Have a go at it: `nc wildwildweb.fluxfingers.net 1426`
