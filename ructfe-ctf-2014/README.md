## Info

INFO /

RuCTFE is an annual online international challenge in information security. It has been held 5 times already.

The contest is driven by classic rules. Each team is given a set of vulnerable services. Organizers regulary fill services with private information â€” the flags. The goal of each team is to find vulnerabilities, fix them in their services and exploit them in order to get flags from other teams. Please refer to the rules page and Wikipedia article for slightly more info.

FLAG == A string that matches regex: /^\w{31}=$/.
