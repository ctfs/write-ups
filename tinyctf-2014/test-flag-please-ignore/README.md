## Write-up

Extracting the provided `misc10.zip` file reveals a text file with the following contents:

```
666c61677b68656c6c6f5f776f726c647d
```

Since this wasnâ€™t accepted as the solution (and neither was `flag{666c61677b68656c6c6f5f776f726c647d}`), I tried to hex-decode it:

```bash
$ xxd -r -p <<< 666c61677b68656c6c6f5f776f726c647d
flag{hello_world}
```

The flag is `flag{hello_world}`.

## Other write-ups

Well, this is interesting, how long is it?

```bash
python -c "print len('666c61677b68656c6c6f5f776f726c647d')"

34
```

That's not a hash length I know of...hmmm, what is it in ascii?

```bash
python -c "print '666c61677b68656c6c6f5f776f726c647d'.decode('hex')"
MONEY!
```
